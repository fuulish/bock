= Bug Flock: The Heist

GameOff 2021 submission

== Abstract

You control the head bug, the master, the leader.
All other bugs (AKA comrades) follow each other, like a wild collection of, ahem, bugs.
Try to gather as many followers as possible and escape the hot pursuit of man's feet.
Along the way, try not to fall victim to frogs.
And, most importantly, gather as much loot as possible and don't lose it and your comrades on your way.

== Controls

Use arrow keys to steer main bug (might not be highlighted).

Alternatively, steer the following feet (not planned to be implemented by the end of this run).
