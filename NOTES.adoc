== Implementation stages

=== General gameplay

* [] No physics only flocking
  ** steer a wild collection of circles
  ** ... that do not interact with each other
  ** ... by steering one particular circle.
  ** ... Apply flocking dynamics.
* [] add plane movement and target area.
* [] dying and winning mechanics
  ** die if you the bottom crosses you
  ** win if you make it to the end
* [] pick up objects
  ** if virtual object radius intersects with x insects
    *** object moves with the COM speed/direction of the sub-flock

* flocking rules
  ** heavier weight to player bug
  ** think about not having flocking rules applied to player bug

* cap the number of bugs allowed on the screen simultaneously
  ** otherwise no one will follow the main bug anymore

* add directionality visualization to show where bugs are headed

* add visible movement of plane to better understand gameplay

=== Yeah, physics

* [] implement bugs as rigid bodies that do interact and collide with each other
* [] add barriers to playing field
* [] add frogs and shooting tongues to the side of the playing field
  ** procedurally added
  ** might be placed farther away from barrier
    *** force the player to make a choice to potentially lose bugs by not fitting through the barrier or by being eating by a frog

=== Yeah, graphics

* [] add textures or any simple visualization
* [] sprites/animation
* [] just make it look nice
