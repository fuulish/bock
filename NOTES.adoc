= Notes

== Other ToDo

* [] refactor/rename global variables (e.g., width and height)

== Implementation stages

=== General gameplay

* [x] No physics only flocking
  ** steer a wild collection of circles
  ** ... that do not interact with each other
  ** ... by steering one particular circle.
  ** ... Apply flocking dynamics.
* [x] add plane movement
* [] add target area.
* [] dying winning mechanics
  ** [x] die if you the bottom crosses you
  ** win if you make it to the end
* [] pick up objects
  ** if virtual object radius intersects with x insects
    *** object moves with the COM speed/direction of the sub-flock

* flocking rules
  ** heavier weight to player bug
  ** think about not having flocking rules applied to player bug

* cap the number of bugs allowed on the screen simultaneously
  ** otherwise no one will follow the main bug anymore

* [x] add directionality visualization to show where bugs are headed

* add visible movement of plane to better understand gameplay
  ** need (some/more) objects (or some sort of ground pattern) to visualize plane movement

* re-add plane movement
  ** add some ground structure to indicate plane movement


=== Yeah, physics

* [] implement bugs as rigid bodies that do interact and collide with each other
* [] add barriers to playing field
* [] add frogs and shooting tongues to the side of the playing field
  ** procedurally added
  ** might be placed farther away from barrier
    *** force the player to make a choice to potentially lose bugs by not fitting through the barrier or by being eating by a frog
  ** rotate according to some rules
    *** e.g., towards the largest flock

=== Yeah, graphics

* [] add textures or any simple visualization
* [] sprites/animation
* [] just make it look nice
